### A photograph tells unspoken stories 

Photography has been used as a way of telling stories for as long as the medium has existed. 
In its simplest form, a single photo in a newspaper fits into this category. 
One image attempting to capture the essence of the written story sharing its page. 
In itâ€™s longer form, a series of photos tells a larger story.
